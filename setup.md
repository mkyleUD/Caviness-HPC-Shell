As stated in the prerequisites, below is an explanation of how to install the required software needed prior to starting the workshop.

## SSH

All students should have an SSH client installed.
SSH is a tool that allows us to connect to and use a remote computer as our own.
Please follow the directions below to install an SSH client for your system.

### Linux

Linux users do not need to install anything, you should be set!

### macOS 

Although macOS comes with SSH pre-installed, 
you will likely want to install [XQuartz](www.xquartz.org) to enable graphical support
(Also known as X11 or Xwin). Graphical support allows you to interact with a programs
graphical user interface (GUI) and view images.

***Note:*** You must restart your computer to complete the installation.


### Windows

PuTTY is used to create a command line interface (CLI) on a remote system from machines running 
a Windows operating system. Unlike Linux/UNIX and Mac, Windows does not have a native terminal
that has an SSH client installed by default. While this is changing in newer versions of Windows,
we are suggesting that all Windows users install and use PuTTY. 

**Download PuTTY** from [UDeploy](https://udeploy.udel.edu/software/putty-with-xming/).
You might also want to download WinSCP, but that will not be needed for the workshop or covered in this setup.

**Install PuTTY**
***Note:*** This will require administrator privileges on your computer .
 
 * **Step 1:** Run the putty-X.XX-install.msi file that was downloaded to begin the installation 
 process. Click "Next".
